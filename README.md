# tips-n-tricks
A collection of overviews, definitions, code samples, tips, and tricks about software development areas that I typically use. This includes the following topics:
- Android development and publishing
- Art assets creation (2D and voxel art)
- Command line usage
- Game development and Unity
- Git version control
- iOS development and publishing
- Web development (HTML, JavaScript, CSS and more)

My intention is to take the various text, markdown, and doc files containing notes, code samples, etc. that are scattered throughout my dev system, Google Drive, and GitHub repos and bring as much of this content as I can into one unified location. I also hope to use this as a central location for future notes.
